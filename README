John Paul Ashenfelter Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it. Originally a lot was copied from Ryan Bates .dotfiles on github, but there have been substantial adjustments made over the past couple years.


Installation

  svn co http://ashenfelterj@transitionpoint.com/svn/tpoint/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install


Environment

MacOSX using the default bash shell

Features

* Shortcuts to common directories in client, server, work directories
  c client_name_<tab>

* Tab completion is also added to git, rake and cap commands:

  rake db:mi<tab>
  cap de<tab>
  git co feature<tab>

To speed things up, the results are cached in local .rake_tasks~ and 
.cap_tasks~. It is smart enough to expire the cache automatically in 
most cases, but you can simply remove the files to flush the cache.

* custom prompt using rvm and git to display details
* common rails aliases
* common mysql aliases for macports
* ssh keys for syncing between machines
* ssl config file
* svn config files
* defaults for ack, autotest, irb, rails, gem, and git
